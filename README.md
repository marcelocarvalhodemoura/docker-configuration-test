# Docker Compose Multi-Container Environment

## Overview
This project sets up a multi-container environment using Docker Compose with a Node.js application and a PostgreSQL database.

## Prerequisites
- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
```
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
```
DB_USER=myuser
DB_PASSWORD=mypassword
```
Adjust the values as necessary.

### 3. Build and Run the Containers
Use Docker Compose to build and run the containers:
```
docker-compose up --build
```
This command will start the Node.js application and the PostgreSQL database.

### 4. Access the Application
The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Database Configuration
- The PostgreSQL database is configured with a persistent volume to ensure data persistence.
- Database credentials are managed using environment variables.

## Security Considerations
- Avoid using the root user for database operations.
- Use environment variables to manage sensitive configurations.

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running.
- Verify that the environment variables in the `.env` file are correctly set.

## Conclusion
This setup provides a robust environment for developing and testing applications with Docker Compose. Feel free to extend the configuration and customize it for your specific needs.
